Hangman Game Rules:

Objective:
The goal of Hangman is to guess the hidden word before a hangman figure is completely drawn.
You win by guessing the word correctly, and you lose if the figure is completed.

Setup:
The word is represented by a series of blank spaces, with one space for each letter of the word.

Gameplay:
The guessing player suggests letters one at a time.
If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position(s).
If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman figure is drawn.

Mistakes:
For each incorrect guess, a new part of the hangman (head, body, arms, legs) is drawn.
The player is usually allowed 9 incorrect guesses before the hangman is fully drawn, and the game is lost.

Winning the Game:
The guessing player wins if they correctly guess all the letters of the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

Losing the Game:
The game is lost if the hangman figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed.

Have fun! :)
